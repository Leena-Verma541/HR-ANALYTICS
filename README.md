# HR-ANALYTICS
Create an interactive HR analytics dashboard using Tableau to analyze employee data from the provided SQLite file. The dashboard should help HR managers gain insights into various aspects of employee performance, engagement, and demographics to support data-driven decision making. 
Overview
This project, undertaken as part of coursework at Lovely Professional University (LPU), focuses on analyzing HR data to gain insights into employee performance, demographics, satisfaction, and attrition. The project aims to assist organizations in making data-driven decisions to improve workforce management and employee satisfaction.

Features
Performance Analysis: Visualization of performance scores across departments, positions, and genders.
Demographics Analysis: Insights into employee age, gender, marital status, and education levels.
Attrition Analysis: Identification of attrition patterns and termination reasons using advanced visualizations.
Compensation Analysis: Study of salary and benefits across different departments, positions, and genders.
Engagement & Satisfaction: Analysis of employee engagement and satisfaction survey results.
Travel Impact Analysis: Examination of how travel frequency and distance from home affect employee performance and satisfaction.
Advanced Insights: Use of Pareto charts to highlight key attrition reasons and clustering techniques to group employees by attributes such as age, performance score, and engagement levels.
Tools and Technologies
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Excel/CSV: Data preparation and cleaning.
